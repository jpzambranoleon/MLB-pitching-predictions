# Predicting Pitch Type in Baseball: A Data Analytics Project

## Introduction

In the realm of baseball, predicting the pitch type thrown by a pitcher to a batter is crucial for both offensive and defensive strategies. Utilizing data analytics techniques, we can leverage the SportData API to collect extensive data on pitcher performance and use it to predict the type of pitch a pitcher is likely to throw in a given situation.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this data analytics project are:

- Data Collection: Utilize the SportData API to gather comprehensive data on baseball games, including pitcher statistics and pitch types.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the data that can be used to predict pitch types effectively.
- Model Development: Build and train machine learning models capable of predicting the pitch type based on the extracted features.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
- Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a user-friendly interface for real-time pitch type prediction.

### Data Collection

We will utilize the SportData API to access a wide range of baseball-related data, including game outcomes, player statistics, and pitch-by-pitch data. The API provides endpoints to query data based on various parameters such as game date, teams involved, and player IDs.

### Data Preprocessing

Before training our predictive model, we need to preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables. Additionally, outliers and inconsistencies in the data will be addressed to ensure the model's accuracy.

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering plays a crucial role in the performance of predictive models. Relevant features such as pitcher velocity, pitch location, previous pitch sequence, and game situation (e.g., inning, score differential) will be extracted from the data and used to train the model.

### Model Development

We will explore different machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting to develop our pitch prediction model. These models will be trained on the preprocessed data and fine-tuned using techniques like cross-validation to optimize their performance.

### Model Evaluation

To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we will use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we will conduct a thorough analysis of the model's predictions, including visualizations of predicted vs. actual pitch types and confusion matrices.

### Deployment

Once we have a reliable model, we will deploy it in a user-friendly interface, allowing coaches, players, and fans to access real-time predictions of pitch types during baseball games. This deployment will facilitate better decision-making and strategic planning during gameplay.

### Conclusion

By leveraging data analytics techniques and the SportData API, we aim to develop a robust model capable of accurately predicting the pitch type thrown by a pitcher in a baseball game. This project has the potential to revolutionize how teams approach pitching strategy and enhance the overall fan experience by providing valuable insights into the dynamics of the game.
